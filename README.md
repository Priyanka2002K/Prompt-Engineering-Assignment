# Prompt Engineering UI Assignment

This repository contains a complete **Prompt-Engineered Frontend UI Project** created by generating modern, responsive UI components using structured meta-prompts. The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate how strong prompts can be used to produce high-quality, reusable frontend sections.

##  Project Overview

This project showcases the following UI sections generated with prompt engineering:

* **Responsive Navigation Bar** (with hamburger menu)
* **Hero Section** (headline, subtext, actions, illustration)
* **Services / Features Section** (6 feature cards)
* **Contact Form Section** (fully responsive with form fields)
* **Footer Section** (4-column layout + social links)

The entire UI is built using **HTML + Tailwind CSS** and follows modern design principles: responsiveness, clean typography, spacing consistency, and accessibility.
